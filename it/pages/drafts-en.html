            <h1 id="how-to-correctly-attribute-sources">How to correctly attribute sources</h1>
<p>Correctly attributing data sources is a requirement on several levels of the <a href="https://opendata.swiss/de/terms-of-use/">Conditions of use on opendata.swiss</a>, where users are required to correctly state the author, title and link of the original dataset.</p>
<p>Both publishers and users should be sure they are correctly attributing the upstream sources of data. Citing sources should be a community norm, not just a provision in an agreement: similar to the best practice of scientific papers, where each paper has a list of references.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Acknowledging sources not only helps credit the work of data publishers, it also helps to identify widely-used, high-quality datasets."</p>
<p><a href="http://theodi.org/blog/5-ways-better-open-data-reuse">5 ways to be a better open data reuser</a> by Leigh Dodds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upstream data sources could be listed in various metadata provided, such as directly within the field descriptions, and in the description attached to the data - such as the one provided on an open data portal.</p>
<h4>Guidance for data publishers</h4>
<p>Visit the following articles in our library for further information on correct attribution and fair use requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is a legal obligation to the source, this is stated as of use in each record. In all other cases, an indication of the source is recommended with regard to the traceability of changes.</p>

<p><strong>1.8 Can the data be used, unless otherwise specified?</strong>
If a legal basis providing a reference for the further use of the corresponding record prescribes that authorities must demand this. For all other records, the authorities may not require the source is acknowledged. On the portal is recommended but the users default for each data set, specify the source.</p>

<p>The report on <a href="/library/bericht-abgrenzung-leistungen">Boundaries between OGD and custom individual services</a> defines in more detail the concept of OGD, explains economic fundamentals of the production and use of open data in government, and provides a decision tree for use in evaluating publication criteria.</p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="evaluate-usage-of-open-data_1">Evaluate usage of open data</h1>
<p>A combination of high-level <em>indicators</em>, and low-level <em>metrics</em> can ensure that OGD projects are both appropriately scoped and planned, and as tools for monitoring and improving data offerings are accessed and interacted with. At their best, they are an instrument for closing the loop to improve collaboration between publisher and data user.</p>
<h2 id="indicators">Indicators</h2>
<p>There is growing scientific interest in monitoring the development of data in an information society.</p>
<p>Dataset usage is even an important measure on an international level, with the <a href="http://index.okfn.org">Global Open Data Index</a> initiative providing a good high level overview of OGD availability around the world. The <a href="http://www.opendatabarometer.org/">Open Data Barometer</a> is a global expert study which dives into even more depth on the how and why's of data openness in different countries.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, studies such as <a href="http://digisus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/OGD-CH-IMF-DACHLI-Bericht-V04-DOWNLOAD-VERSION.pdf">Ein Impact Monitoring Framework f&uuml;r Open Government Data am Beispiel von &raquo;OGD Schweiz&laquo;</a> (Dapp/St&uuml;rmer 2013) and <a href="http://www.wirtschaft.bfh.ch/de/forschung/aktuell/newsdetails/article/studie-zu-open-government-data-in-der-schweiz/1100.html">Studie zu Open Government Data in der Schweiz</a> (BFH 2012) provide indicators of economic and sociometric analysis.</p>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>Active use of metrics can be used to judge the relative interest in different datasets, or evaluate approaches taken in disseminating the content. Metrics data (web, server, repos, social) can be used to back up strategic decisions in the evolution of the data.</p>
<p>Open source software that can be used to collect and re-publish metrics include <a href="http://www.piwik.org/">Piwik</a>, which is the tool used on <strong>opendata.swiss</strong>. Metrics data can also be embedded in the form of widgets into websites, and the metrics data in itself could be opened for public reuse.</p>

<h1 id="check-existing-legal-frameworks_1">Check existing legal frameworks</h1>
<p>What are the main legal frameworks that data publishers in Switzerland need to be aware of? What aspects and decision points do we need to be aware of when supporting Open Government Data? These resources will help you make sense and tackle grey area in regards to your organization's needs.</p>

<h1 id="host-data-on-the-world-wide-web">Host data on the World Wide Web</h1>
<p>This topic covers a few pointers to help with publishing data on the web. To reference data on a web-based open data portal, it should be available online. Additional barriers, such as having to access protected networks or order CD-ROMs, reduce the accessibility of data. Are web publications harder to support? We contend that, given the alternatives, it is not. If the appropriate infrastructure is in place, web hosted data can be inexpensive and easy to support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data should be priced at no more than a reasonable cost of reproduction, preferably as a free download from the Internet. This pricing model is achieved because your agency should not undertake any cost when it provides data for use.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="checklist-for-hosting-web-data">Checklist for hosting web data</h3>
<p>Here are some aspects to consider when setting up web hosting for your data:</p>
<p><strong><checkbox> Cloud vs. data center?</checkbox></strong></p>
<p>Here we refer to the way your content is serviced on the Internet. In a data center, your organization would typically be responsible for running a "full stack", or entire collection, of applications required for web hosting. This means providing support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS">DNS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP">SMTP</a> and other critical protocols using specialized "server" programs. You often have the ability to decide on each of these components and pick the best combination. In a cloud environment, there is sometimes considerably less flexibility, however by centralizing administration and maintenance, the overall costs per site can be much lower.</p>
<p><strong><checkbox> How accessible are backups?</checkbox></strong></p>
<p>Preparing for disasters, and ensuring that data does not get lost during updates or changes, are extremely important tasks in setting up for long-term hosting. Ensure that you know how to get duplicates of your data, which are ideally being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">versioned</a> for selective restoration, find out how much time and effort this process takes - and test it in advance, to be calm and prepared for any eventuality.</p>
<p><strong><checkbox> Are there bandwidth restrictions?</checkbox></strong></p>
<p>As every smartphone user knows, access to data comes at a cost. Whether it is uploading large datasets, or potentially being restricted from sharing your data to a large number of users, check with your hosting provider on what are the financial and technical aspects of this question. For instance, some providers can put special measures in place to "scale up" the rate at which your content is being distributed ahead of a marketing campaign or publicity - ensuring that none of your visitors get to see error messages or outages.</p>
<p><strong><checkbox> Is there a redundancy measure in place?</checkbox></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)">Redundancy</a> is the concept of having alternative copies of the same information. In the case of web hosting, this often means having multiple servers in multiple locations provisioning the exact same content. This is useful for maximing performance across the world, or having a "safe failover" - in case one of the copies (for example, of an e-commerce web site) is for some reason inaccessible, one of the others immediately/automatically take over, and no business is lost.</p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="what-datasets-does-my-organization-have_1">What datasets does my organization have?</h1>
<p>It is easy to start keeping track of datasets in a table or spreadsheet, but in a larger organization multiple people and departments collaborate on this task. One of the most important processes behind the creation of the data portals, essential to data services in a large organization, is to create a <em>data inventory</em>.</p>
<p>This is a listing of internal datasets created, maintained or even just stored within an organization or organizational unit. At its most basic, it is a list of data sources. A sophisticated inventory contains additional information about each dataset, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>what format the data is in</li>
<li>whether it is linked to databases</li>
<li>does it contain private or sensitive information</li>
<li>where it is stored</li>
<li>what are conditions of use</li>
<li>at what URL it has been published</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="guidelines-for-swiss-publishers-of-ogd">Guidelines for Swiss publishers of OGD</h3>
<p>In the report <a href="/library/m4-datebestaende-bund">Databases of the Confederation</a>, additional details are available which are particularly relevant to public institutions in Switzerland:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The focus [of a data inventory] is on databases, registers and similar forms of official databases, which are managed by federal agencies under its legal mandate. This regardless of whether they are publicly available today or not. These databases provide potentially a huge benefit to the public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report also mentions what does <em>not</em> need to be inventarised:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Documents, business files or classification systems - i.e. only structured data collections;</li>
<li>All kinds of personal data collections of individual employees of the administration, which have been created ad hoc for their needs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h1 id="how-to-manage-metadata_1">How to manage metadata</h1>
<p>Methods of developing and maintaining metadata are used for validating quality and ensuring applicability of the datasets at large, and are a critical support vehicle for improving the potential for appropriate usage of open data.</p>
<p>When we say &lsaquo;data&rsaquo;, we mean &lsaquo;datasets&rsaquo; and &lsaquo;resources&rsaquo;. By <strong>metadata</strong>, we mean both <em>structural metadata</em>, design and specification of data structures; and <em>descriptive metadata</em>, which describes individual instances of content (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">Metadata</a> - Wikipedia).</p>
<h2 id="steps-in-managing-datasets">Steps in managing datasets</h2>
<p>Important steps in the process of uploading and managing a dataset include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring the latest <em>versions</em> of content is available</li>
<li>appropriate <em>taxonometry</em> and <em>categorisation</em></li>
<li>correct and complete <em>labels and tagging</em> (see <a href="/publish/swiss">applying metadata</a>)</li>
<li>validating <em>license</em> details and <em>contact</em> information</li>
<li>testing <em>links</em> to download/preview the data and related resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these steps are grounded in creating high quality metadata.</p>
<h2 id="metadata-harvesting">Metadata harvesting</h2>
<p>For larger organizations with their own infrastructure, it often becomes inconvenient and costly to upload datasets one at a time, so software programs called <strong>harvesters</strong> are used to collect details on each dataset and publish a selection of metadata to the data portal. These programs can also be run automatically to ensure that updates are propagated.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-metadata-on-opendataswiss">Publishing metadata on opendata.swiss</h2>
<p>You need to publish standardised information about your data, so-called metadata.  For publishers, the national Open Government Data portal <strong>opendata.swiss</strong> offers different ways to add their data to the metadata catalogue. The Open Government Data Switzerland project has developed a joint solution (see <a href="/category/library">M8 - Selection and definition of the OGD standards</a>). The portal opendata.swiss implements these standards, and provides further documentation on the DCAT-AP standard: visit <a href="/publish/opendata-swiss">Publishing on opendata.swiss</a> for background.</p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="role-of-open-data-portals_1">Role of open data portals</h1>
<p>A <em>data portal</em> is an online collection of links to resources - scroll down in this topic for some examples. This has similarities to a Document Management System, which often provides the ability to directly download and/or query structured data. These datasets are often collected with involvement of the maintainers of the data portal - though not always, as in the case of crowd-sourced portals like <a href="http://datahub.io">Datahub.io</a>, or linked data portals like <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-data-portals-for">What are data portals for?</h3>
<p>Data portals are designed to put together datasets from across many sources in one place, presenting information about them consistently, and including features that assist end users in <em>discovering</em> the datasets they need. They also play an important role in connecting the data publisher and end user, for instance allowing people to more easily keep track of <em>updates and changes</em> to datasets they are using.</p>
<p>Most data portals combine datasets which are directly distributed on site, and remote datasets which are linked from the portal. Sometimes larger sized files and special requirements like geodata services are <em>hosted</em> externally, but in the the best case the user does not have to be aware of such details - and just use the data.</p>
<p>As data portals proliferate (there are several thousand portal projects worldwide), the question arises of what happens when datasets are published in multiple locations. <em>Federation</em> between portals is a kind of software contract that allows content to be shared between them.</p>
<h3 id="portals-for-open-data">Portals for open data</h3>
<p>An <em>open data portal</em> is one that has a focus on providing datasets which are licensed under open conditions. See <a href="/identify/criteria">criteria for OGD</a> for more background. Open data portals provide access to data mainly from government offices (<a href="/publish/opendata-swiss">opendata.swiss</a>), science and academia (<a href="http://openresearchdata.ch">openresearchdata.ch</a>), maps and Geographic Information Systems (<a href="http://geo.admin.ch">geo.admin.ch</a>), and so on. The <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/how-to-open-up-data/#for-government">Open Data Handbook</a> has more background on how open data portals work and their benefits to the user community.</p>

<h1 id="prepare-data-for-publication_1">Prepare data for publication</h1>
<p>A number of open data formats are available that are accessible on all platforms, without the restrictions of proprietary standards.</p>
<p>When one thinks of "data", what usually comes to mind are words and numbers arranged in tables. However, this is by far not the only kind of data included in the notion of Open Government Data (OGD). Everything from text documents produced during meetings, to bitmap image files, to maps and specialized data (e.g. from weather sensors), can be published as OGD.</p>
<p>Most important when considering data formats is the <em>structure</em> and <em>portability</em> of the container for your data. A well structured spreadsheet, for instance, is easy to read and managed. It has appropriate and helpful metadata, and when the data is expanded or updated, it is clear where new information needs to go. Portable data formats are non-proprietary, so the files can be opened with generally available or free software on any computer platform, and part of a widely accepted <em>standard</em>.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/01911/index.html?lang=en">SIARD eCH-0165</a> is a set of recommendations for the Archiving of Databases developed by the Swiss association eCH.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making sure that you are providing machine-readable formats allows for greatest re-use. To illustrate this, consider statistics published as PDF (Portable Document Format) documents, often used for high quality printing. While these statistics can be read by humans, they are very hard for a computer to use. This greatly limits the ability for others to re-use that data.</p>
<p><a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/how-to-open-up-data/#make-data-available-technical-openness">Open Data Handbook</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tools-for-migration">Tools for migration</h2>
<p>There are many tools that are used in migrating (or converting) from one format to another. One needs to consider both how well the metadata and the actual data is preserved when it is moved from one format or environment to another, potentially reducing longer term costs of maintenance and reuse.</p>
<p>Standards like the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</a> (OAI-PMH) and those of <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/standards">OASIS</a> with newer initiatives like <a href="http://datapipes.okfnlabs.org/">Data Pipies</a> and <a href="http://bubbles.databrewery.org/">Bubbles</a>, are technical and logistical initiatives for making migrations happen more efficiently.</p>

<p>A number of open data formats are available that are accessible on all platforms, without the restrictions of proprietary standards.</p>
<p>When one thinks of "data", what usually comes to mind are words and numbers arranged in tables. However, this is by far not the only kind of data included in the notion of Open Government Data (OGD). Everything from text documents produced during meetings, to bitmap image files, to maps and specialized data (e.g. from weather sensors), can be published as OGD.</p>
<p>Most important when considering data formats is the <em>structure</em> and <em>portability</em> of the container for your data. A well structured spreadsheet, for instance, is easy to read and managed. It has appropriate and helpful metadata, and when the data is expanded or updated, it is clear where new information needs to go. Portable data formats are non-proprietary, so the files can be opened with generally available or free software on any computer platform, and part of a widely accepted <em>standard</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/01911/index.html?lang=en">SIARD eCH-0165</a> is a set of recommendations for the Archiving of Databases developed by the Swiss association eCH.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making sure that you are providing machine-readable formats allows for greatest re-use. To illustrate this, consider statistics published as PDF (Portable Document Format) documents, often used for high quality printing. While these statistics can be read by humans, they are very hard for a computer to use. This greatly limits the ability for others to re-use that data.</p>

<p>What we understand by data in the context of OGD is often the kind of specialised and detailed information that preoccupies teams of experts in statistics departments, university and corporate research labs. While expert users continue to be the focus and often the motivators of data collection, today's "data users" represent only a small part of the global interest potential.</p>

<h3 id="data-for-government">Data for government</h3>
<p>Government data is generally created or mandated by government agencies, in the service of their own or another department. Sometimes the efforts undertaken to collect data are massive, take for example the large departments involved with environmental or economic data collection.</p>
<p>What happens once the original purpose of the data has been served? If another department wishes to take on the role of continuing to keep the information updated, would it be possible to transfer the competencies and methods? Can we afford to throw away and re-start efforts to create high quality data? By opening data within government, a major goal is to address these problems through models of sustainability similar to those being applied in society in response to economic and environmental crises.</p>
<h3 id="data-reuse">Data reuse</h3>
<p>Along with all the information relevant to its use and maintenance, data becomes an asset whose value is dramatically increased when proper standards are set to ensure its long-term applicability, and the conditions for its use are simplified.</p>
<p>To make good on this vision, more acceptance is needed on portability and transparency of processes throughout government organizations. It should be commonplace for one department to reuse the work of another without having to wait for weeks for permission or budget approval. Lightweight projects requiring a minimum of expenditure in IT will become possible when the necessary policy and technology standards become widespread.</p>
<h3 id="data-for-expertise">Data for expertise</h3>
<p>For the overwhelming majority of users of data, applications and publications (websites, reports) are the gateway to data. The average user is a person who will rarely be interested in the raw data itself - rather than the way it can be used and visualized. The value of investing into improvements in data quality and availability seem difficult to justify only for the sake of an expert minority. So who are we opening data for? In order to find an answer to this question we need to understand how data is used.</p>
<p>Movements to popularize the various concepts of data (from open data to cloud computing) have focused their efforts to promoting the development of useful new apps - useful in terms of providing utility to the end-user. Often in the process they are showcasing the way open government data can be used, without expecting their audience to be involved in accessing or publishing data themselves.</p>
<h3 id="information-society">Information society</h3>
<p>The implications of a wide variety of high quality open data become even more clear when high demand for new applications around the country and worldwide is considered. Users such as non-technical experts or businesses will often have other means - paid, and so on - to get access to raw data. Open data can enable anyone to build things with information that would otherwise lie locked up, dormant, and of little use.</p>
<p>In building up a community of interest, mobile apps and other interfaces will represent the accomplishments of developers, and their collaboration with experts, data owners, designers, and so on. They highlight the availability of new data sets, help explore the opportunities and gaps, and reflect by their impact the public interest. Apps will also often be more quickly and cheaply developed if the data sets are highly accessible, and developers spend less time on cleaning up and converting the data, building upon the work of others.</p>
<p>The value of opening up government data stores to the public will be most clearly illustrated through the apps that will be built with them. In order to succeed with publishing data we need to think of possible non-primary uses for the data and in some cases even make improvements to the data in such a way that apps can be built from them.</p>
<h3 id="a-remixing-of-roles">A remixing of roles</h3>
<p>To use data effectively many roles are involved. It could be the same person, or an entire organisation. Here are some of the 'needs' of data:</p>
<ul>
<li>While being created, its consistency, completeness and accuracy needs to be ensured.</li>
<li>When collected and recorded, appropriate meta-data needs to explain and identify it.</li>
<li>As it is published or even just stored for later use, appropriate standards must be applied.</li>
<li>Statistics help to validate against errors, and understand how the data can be used.</li>
<li>Designing and creating charts and visualisations help to paint the bigger picture.</li>
<li>Using programming or analysis, decisions can be facilitated according to some logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>More often than not, successful applications of government data are a collaboration of individuals who may never meet, but whose work ties into each of the others. Lots of effort can go into every single set of data to increase the chance of succeeding down the line.</p>
