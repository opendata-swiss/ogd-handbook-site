In the public administration, this decision normally depends on the legal framework, in other words a law or the associated ordinance. This will allow for publication of the data and set out any restrictions. You can then decide on the terms of use for your data based on this.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following diagram explains step by step how you establish whether a dataset is suitable for OGD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Schema Arbeitshilfe-Publikation" src="../../images/chart-arbeitshilfe-publikation-de.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further guidance on the individual steps can be found in &lt;a href="/de/library/entscheid-rechtsgrundlagen"&gt;Decision basis - guidelines in respect to legal foundations for the publication of data as OGD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also find an overview of the various legal issues relevant to OGD in the concept &lt;a href="/en/library/konzept-rechtliche-rahmen"&gt;Legal framework for the publication of data as Open Government Data (OGD)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="/en/prepare/terms"&gt;Choosing terms of use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Choosing terms of use</title><link href="//handbook.opendata.swiss/en/prepare/terms.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-24T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-06-24T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Open Government Data Switzerland</name></author><id>tag:handbook.opendata.swiss,2016-06-24:/en/prepare/terms.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As explained in the “Preliminary legal checks” section, there is normally a legal framework setting out the conditions under which a dataset from the public administration can be used. Laws and ordinances are often difficult for users of the data to understand. The large number of laws also means it is far from simple to maintain an overview.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For this reason, “&lt;a href="https://opendata.swiss/en/terms-of-use/"&gt;terms of use&lt;/a&gt;” are displayed for every dataset on opendata.swiss. Using a small number of symbols and sentences, these explain what a dataset can be used for. They translate the applicable legal framework into a standardized language that users can understand. As an authority publishing data, you must therefore select a set of terms of use that correctly reflects your legal framework before publishing your data on opendata.swiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find an overview of the terms of use &lt;a href="https://opendata.swiss/en/terms-of-use/"&gt;permitted on opendata.swiss here&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the results of the &lt;a href="/en/prepare/frameworks"&gt;preliminary legal check&lt;/a&gt; you can now simply select the right terms of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Result of preliminary legal check&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Terms of use&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The dataset may be published on opendata.swiss without restrictions on use.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Open use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/terms_open.svg" width="38" height="58"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The dataset may be published on opendata.swiss but the source must be indicated.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Open use. Must provide the source. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/terms_by.svg" width="74" height="58"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Special case: you have answered “yes” to all the questions in the diagram up to the question regarding commercial use or the one regarding citing the source (see explanation below).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Open use. Use for commercial purposes requires permission of the data owner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/terms_ask.svg" width="84" height="58"&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Or &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Open use. Must provide the source. Use for commercial purposes requires permission of the data owner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/terms_by-ask.svg" width="120" height="58"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Not OGD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Publication on opendata.swiss is not permitted.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special case: if your legal framework does not permit commercial use, you cannot currently publish your data on opendata.swiss. If commercial use is permitted in principle but permission is required, this corresponds to the special case. If you subsequently publish the data on opendata.swiss, you should decide in advance that you will normally permit commercial use. Data subject to more restrictive conditions are not published on opendata.swiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need your terms of use and the link to the legal framework later for the catalogue &lt;a href="/en/publish/swiss"&gt;metadata on opendata.swiss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details of legal issues related to OGD are contained in the concept &lt;a href="/en/library/konzept-rechtliche-rahmen"&gt;Legal framework for the publication of data as open government data (OGD)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Data hosting</title><link href="//handbook.opendata.swiss/en/prepare/hosting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-01-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Open Government Data Switzerland</name></author><id>tag:handbook.opendata.swiss,2016-01-02:/en/prepare/hosting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order for you to import data to the opendata.swiss catalogue, the data must be freely accessible somewhere. Only the metadata and a link to the data are published on opendata.swiss. Responsibility for actual data hosting lies with the data supplier.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Data hosting is now relatively cheap and simple to manage, even if you do not yet have a solution in place within your organization. However, there are some issues you should consider before publication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;checkbox&gt; Cloud vs. data center?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we refer to the way your content is serviced on the Internet. In a data center, your organization would typically be responsible for running a "full stack", or entire collection, of applications required for web hosting. This means providing support for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS"&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP"&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP"&gt;SMTP&lt;/a&gt; and other critical protocols using specialized "server" programs. You often have the ability to decide on each of these components and pick the best combination. In a cloud environment, there is sometimes considerably less flexibility, however by centralizing administration and maintenance, the overall costs per site can be much lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;checkbox&gt; How accessible are backups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing for disasters, and ensuring that data does not get lost during updates or changes, are extremely important tasks in setting up for long-term hosting. Ensure that you know how to get duplicates of your data, which are ideally being &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control"&gt;versioned&lt;/a&gt; for selective restoration, find out how much time and effort this process takes - and test it in advance, to be calm and prepared for any eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;checkbox&gt; Are there bandwidth restrictions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As every smartphone user knows, access to data comes at a cost. Whether it is uploading large datasets, or potentially being restricted from sharing your data to a large number of users, check with your hosting provider on what are the financial and technical aspects of this question. For instance, some providers can put special measures in place to "scale up" the rate at which your content is being distributed ahead of a marketing campaign or publicity - ensuring that none of your visitors get to see error messages or outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;checkbox&gt; Is there a redundancy measure in place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)"&gt;Redundancy&lt;/a&gt; is the concept of having alternative copies of the same information. In the case of web hosting, this often means having multiple servers in multiple locations provisioning the exact same content. This is useful for maximing performance across the world, or having a "safe failover" - in case one of the copies (for example, of an e-commerce web site) is for some reason inaccessible, one of the others immediately/automatically take over, and no business is lost.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
